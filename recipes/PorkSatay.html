        <p>I'm not exactly sure how much pork satay they eat in Penang,
            but I'm confident that <br>your average pork-loving Malaysian would enjoy this explosive combination of
            flavors.<br>
            Use a fairly large chunk of pork, because it doesn't take long to develop that beautifully brown,<br> crusty
            exterior on the grill. Or in a broiler turned to
            high.
            Or in the oven at 500 degrees! <br>Serve over rice with peanut sauce and cucumber salad.

            <li>1 teaspoon chipotle chili powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>¼ cup rice vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon tamarind paste</li>
            <li>½ bunch lightly packed cilantro leaves and stems</li>
            <li>1 (2 1/2 pound) pork shoulder roast</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>5 large metal skewers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Place fresh turmeric in a food processor along with powdered turmeric.
                Add ginger, shallot, garlic, brown sugar, ancho chili<br> powder, coriander, chipotle,
                cayenne, rice vinegar, soy sauce, fish sauce,
                tamarind paste, and cilantro. Blend into a fine paste.</li>
            <li>Cut pork into 1 1/2-inch cubes, trimming off fat as needed. Place pork in a bowl; season with salt.
                Pour
                in the marinade. <br>Mix and massage pork with your hands until completely coated. Cover with
                plastic
                wrap
                and refrigerate for 4 to 18 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Thread pork through skewers
                so
                the pieces are<br> touching but not squished together. Reserve leftover marinade.</li>
            <li>Grill skewers, brushing on reserved marinade, until pork just starts to firm up but is still slightly
                pink in the center, about 10<br> minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
                should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Serve immediately.</li>

        </ol>
